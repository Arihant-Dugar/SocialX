This is a News App which fetches the News from newsapi.org and Displays it on the screen with Login and Signup Authentication feature.

Libraries, Dependencies and Implementaion used :

1) Gilde Library to set the Image in the Imageview that is fetched from the api response.
2) Volley Library to get the Json response object from the api.
3) Firebase Integration and authentication(Google and Facebook) dependencies
4) newsapi.org news api to fetch Indian news only.
5) View Binding was used for quick acess to views and layouts.
6) Fragments were used for login and signup screens bcoz they are lighter than an activity.
7) Singleton class was made to call the api bcoz only 1 instance can be made of that class and can't be called from mutliple places im the project.
